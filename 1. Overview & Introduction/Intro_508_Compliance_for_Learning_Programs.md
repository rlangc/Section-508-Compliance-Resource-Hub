# Introduction to Section 508 Compliance for Learning Programs

## What is Section 508?

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that all federal agencies—and organizations working with them—ensure their electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. This includes digital content such as training documents, eLearning modules, websites, multimedia, and software systems used in learning environments.

In practice, 508 compliance means designing digital experiences that can be navigated, understood, and interacted with by all users—regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use.

## Why It Matters in Learning Programs

Instructional content that is not accessible creates barriers for learners with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Accessibility is not just a legal requirement—it's a foundational aspect of inclusive instructional design. Ensuring compliance helps:

- Promote equitable access to education and professional development
- Improve usability and clarity for all learners
- Mitigate legal and reputational risk
- Align with universal design principles and WCAG 2.1 standards
