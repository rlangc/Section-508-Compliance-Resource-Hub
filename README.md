# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Section 508 Compliance in Training Documents, Interactive Multimedia Courses, and PowerPoint Presentations

<h3>1. Purpose</h3>

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes a standardized approach to ensure compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act when developing and delivering training materials, interactive multimedia courses, and PowerPoint presentations. The goal is to provide equitable access to all learners, including individuals with disabilities, by incorporating accessibility best practices.

<h3>2. Scope</h3>

This SOP applies to all instructional designers, content developers, training facilitators, and other personnel responsible for creating digital learning content within the organization.

<h3>3. Responsibilities</h3>

- Instructional Designers: Ensure all training content meets Section 508 accessibility requirements
- Multimedia Developers: Implement accessibility features in interactive multimedia courses
- Content Reviewers: Conduct accessibility audits and testing
- Trainers & Facilitators: Ensure accessibility in live and recorded training sessions
- IT & Compliance Officers: Provide oversight and verify compliance

<h3>4. Definitions</h3>

- Section 508: A federal law requiring that electronic and information technology be accessible to individuals with disabilities
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG): Standards that define how to make web content more accessible
- Assistive Technologies: Includes screen readers, braille displays, and voice recognition software

<h2>5. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</h2>
