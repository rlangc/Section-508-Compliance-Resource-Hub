# 508 Evaluation Frameworks for Digital Learning Content

## Purpose

This document provides a structured overview of evaluation frameworks and methodologies used to assess Section 508 compliance in instructional materials and digital learning experiences. It is designed to help instructional designers, developers, compliance teams, and quality assurance personnel identify, document, and remediate accessibility issues across training programs.

---

## Why Use a Framework?

Evaluation frameworks provide consistency, transparency, and accountability when assessing accessibility. By using structured evaluation methods, teams can:

- Measure content against recognized accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1, Section 508)
- Ensure content works for users with disabilities
- Track and resolve compliance issues efficiently
- Provide documentation for internal audits and external reviews

---

## Core Evaluation Models

### 1. **WCAG 2.1 AA Mapping**
All evaluations should align with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, which serve as the technical foundation for Section 508.

**Core Principles:**
- **Perceivable** – Content is available to all senses
- **Operable** – All functionality is keyboard accessible
- **Understandable** – Content is clear and predictable
- **Robust** – Content works with assistive technologies

### 2. **508 Evaluation Criteria Matrix**
Use a compliance matrix to track success criteria, testing results, and remediation actions across content types.

**Matrix Columns May Include:**
- Content Type (e.g., PDF, eLearning, PowerPoint)
- WCAG/508 Criteria
- Pass/Fail
- Testing Method Used
- Notes / Recommendations
- Responsible Party
- Status (Open, Resolved)

## Testing Methods

### Manual Testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard-only navigation checks (Tab, Enter, Space)
- Alt text and form label verification
- Color contrast checks using tools or manual inspection

### Automated Testing
- **WAVE**: Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool  
- **ANDI**: Accessible Name & Description Inspector  
- **Axe DevTools**: Browser-based automated testing  
- **Storyline/Rise/Captivate Checkers**: Built-in accessibility scans  

> ⚠️ *Note: Automated tools can identify 20–40% of issues. Manual testing is essential for full coverage.*

## Sample Evaluation Workflow

1. **Pre-Evaluation**
   - Define content types and platforms in scope
   - Confirm WCAG/508 criteria to be used
   - Prepare documentation (checklists, templates, audit logs)

2. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Conduct manual + automated testing
   - Record findings in the compliance matrix
   - Annotate issues with screenshots or examples

3. **Remediation & Re-Testing**
   - Assign issues to content owners
   - Re-test resolved items
   - Update documentation

4. **Final Validation**
   - Confirm all items pass criteria
   - Export audit documentation
   - Submit signed validation log (if required)

- `ScreenReader_Testing_Guide.pdf`  
- `Color_Contrast_Checklist.pdf`  
- `Remediation_Prioritization_Rubric.md`

## Reporting and Compliance Evidence

Create a final evaluation report that includes:
- Summary of issues found and resolved
- Tool(s) used for testing
- Screenshots or transcripts of screen reader outputs
- Accessibility statement and sign-off documentation

## Continuous Improvement

- Integrate accessibility evaluations into design sprints and QA cycles
- Conduct periodic audits of legacy content
- Update frameworks as standards evolve (e.g., WCAG 2.2, future 508 updates)
