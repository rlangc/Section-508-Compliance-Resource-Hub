# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): 508 Compliance for Interactive Learning Courses

## 1. Purpose

This SOP outlines the required steps for ensuring Section 508 compliance in the development, testing, and deployment of interactive learning courses. It is intended to guide instructional designers, developers, and quality assurance personnel in building accessible, inclusive digital learning experiences using tools such as Articulate Storyline, Rise, Adobe Captivate, and HTML5 frameworks.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to all interactive courses developed or procured for learning and development programs delivered through Learning Management Systems (LMS), public websites, or internal digital platforms.

---

## 3. Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-------------------|
| Instructional Designer | Design content to align with accessibility standards |
| eLearning Developer | Build and configure interactive elements for accessibility |
| QA/Accessibility Reviewer | Conduct accessibility testing and remediation |
| Project Manager | Ensure accessibility milestones are met in timelines |
| LMS Administrator | Validate proper delivery and performance of accessible content |

---

## 4. Tools and Standards

- **Accessibility Standards:** Section 508, WCAG 2.1 (AA)
- **Development Tools:** Articulate Storyline/Rise, Adobe Captivate, HTML5 authoring tools
- **Testing Tools:** WAVE, ANDI, NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, Tab-key testing
- **Reference:** [https://www.section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov)

## 5. Procedures

### Step 1: Planning and Design
- Include accessibility goals in project scope documents
- Choose interactions that support keyboard navigation
- Avoid content that relies on drag-and-drop or mouse-only input without alternatives
- Structure content using a logical tab order and navigation flow

### Step 2: Authoring Content
- Use built-in accessibility features in authoring tools (e.g., focus order in Storyline)
- Ensure:
  - **Alt text** is applied to all meaningful images
  - **Descriptive text** is used for buttons, links, and interactions
  - **Color contrast** meets WCAG 2.1 AA minimums (4.5:1)
  - **Text** is resizable and readable without assistive technologies
  - **Instructions** do not rely on color or sound alone

### Step 3: Multimedia Compliance
- Add **closed captions** to all audio/video content
- Provide **audio descriptions** where visual-only elements are critical to understanding
- Include **text-based transcripts** for narrated segments or dialogues
- Ensure video players are keyboard accessible and support screen readers

### Step 4: Testing and Verification
- **Keyboard Test**: Ensure all interactions are navigable via keyboard (Tab/Enter)
- **Screen Reader Test**: Validate screen reader output using NVDA or JAWS
- **Tool Audit**: Use WAVE or ANDI to check for errors and contrast issues
- Use **built-in accessibility checker** (e.g., Storyline’s checker) to identify basic issues

### Step 5: LMS Upload and Validation
- Export courses in **SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004, or xAPI**, depending on platform
- Test course playback and accessibility in the LMS (e.g., keyboard focus, transcript visibility)
- Confirm accessibility documentation is attached for compliance reporting

---

## 6. Remediation Process

If issues are identified during testing:
- Track defects in an accessibility audit log
- Prioritize fixes by severity (e.g., screen reader blocking > visual-only content)
- Re-test all resolved items prior to deployment
- Document final accessibility validation with reviewer name and date

---

## 7. Version Control & Maintenance

- Store source files and published versions in a version-controlled repository
- Maintain a changelog of accessibility updates
- Periodically review older content for updates to meet evolving standards

## 9. Notes

This SOP is subject to periodic review to align with updated accessibility guidelines and organizational requirements. Teams should incorporate accessibility as a continuous practice—not a final task—within the instructional design lifecycle.
